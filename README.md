Hello! This is my first full fledged Java project that I have created to simulate a dynasty FF startup draft.

This app collects data from an API (thanks u/TheRealMonty!) about startup ADP (average draft position), and simulates bots with different algorithms picking players, with options to save teams available.

This is still a work in progress, with a GUI and other features inbound (hopefully) soon. Would appreciate any suggestions or feedback!
